# NN_MineralPrediction
MSc Petroleum Engineering Thesis (Neural Network Mineral Prediction)
The MATLAB codes aim to perform the following:
1) Create synthetic training data of elemental weight fractions and mineral weight and volume fractions
2) Create and train a neural network to estimate mineral weight fractions an volumes from spectroscopy-measured elemental weight fractions
3) Back-calculates the weight fractions of minerals from the neural network output volume fractions (to compare with XRD data)
